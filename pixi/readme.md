# Simple Pixi Game


In order to run the [Pixi](http://www.pixijs.com) version of the [Lost Decade game](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/) you will need nodejs/npm.  Pixi will dynamically load the images and will throw a cross-origin error if the page isn't being served.

Currently the demo is using Pixi `1.5.1`

    # install the nodejs modules (express)
    npm install .

Run the server

    # starts the server
    npm start
